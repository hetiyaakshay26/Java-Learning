# Learning Java
## What is Java 
 Java is high level, object-oriented, class-based, programming language 
 Every thing in java is written insde class
 
 ### **Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995**

 ***James Gosling** is the father of java*
 
**Basic java Code snippet**

```java
    public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
        }
```
**public static void main(String[] args)**  is the main function from where code execution starts

**System.out.println();** is used to print something on screen

### Rules for declearing variables 

* A variable name can consist of Capital letters A-Z, lowercase letters a-z digits 0-9,
  and two special characters such as _ underscore and $ dollar sign.
* The first character must not be a digit.
* Blank spaces cannot be used in variable names.
* Java keywords cannot be used as variable names.
* Variable names are case-sensitive.
* There is no limit on the length of a variable name but by convention, it should be between 4 to 15 chars.
* Variable names always should exist on the left-hand side of assignment operators.

### Datatypes
***Java is Statically typed language***
means we need to declare the data type of variable before using

There are two types of data in java
1. Primitive Datatype
    * int
    * byte
    * short
    * long
    * float
    * double
    * char
    * boolean
2. Derived Datatypes 
    * Array
    * string
